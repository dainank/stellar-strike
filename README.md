# Stellar Strike
> A retro game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). 

Inspired by [_Astrosmash_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrosmash), _Stellar Strike_ is an NES game where the player uses a laser cannon to destroy falling meteors, bombs, and other targets.

Topics explored throughout development of this project include:
- structure of games
- 6502 Assembly language
- creating graphics (background/moving objects)
- reading input
- collision detection
- tracking player score
- sound effects and music

Documentation and notes can be found under the `~/docs` directory.  **[`1 - Context`](./docs/1_Context.md) is a good place to start.** Docs might get migrated to a dedicated static site at a later stage for ease of reading.
